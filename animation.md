# Webaverse Animations

###### tags: `webaverse`

## Webaverse Animation System 

Webaverse Animations can be broken up into a few categories: 
* skeletal based animation for the avatar 
* vr input that will control the avatar 
* physics and ik constraints that affect the avatar 
* facial animation is controlled via blend shapes

All of these systems work together to produce a final result that allows maximum flexibility for Webaverse users in how there avatar is controlled and expressed. 

## Avatars 
Avatars in Webaverse are VRM based models which use a default set of GLTF based animations when vr inputs are not used. Vr inputs can vary so as a result Webaverse supports multiple types of VR input control of the avatar which can range from simple to full body mocap suits to control the avatar.
